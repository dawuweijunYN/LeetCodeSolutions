"""Given two strings representing two complex numbers.You need to return a string representing their multiplication. Note i2 = -1 according to the definition.Example 1:Input: "1+1i", "1+1i"Output: "0+2i"Explanation: (1 + i) * (1 + i) = 1 + i2 + 2 * i = 2i, and you need convert it to the form of 0+2i.Example 2:Input: "1+-1i", "1+-1i"Output: "0+-2i"Explanation: (1 - i) * (1 - i) = 1 + i2 - 2 * i = -2i, and you need convert it to the form of 0+-2i.Note:The input strings will not have extra blank.The input strings will be given in the form of a+bi, where the integer a and b will both belong to the range of [-100, 100]. And the output should be also in this form."""class Solution(object):    def complexNumberMultiply(self, a, b):        """        :type a: str        :type b: str        :rtype: str        """        re1,im1=[int(i) for i in a.strip("i").split("+")]        re2,im2=[int(i) for i in b.strip("i").split("+")]        re=re1*re2-im1*im2        im=re1*im2+re2*im1        return str(re)+"+"+str(im)+"i"
