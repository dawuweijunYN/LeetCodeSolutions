"""Suppose you have a random list of people standing in a queue. Each person is described by a pair of integers (h, k), where h is the height of the person and k is the number of people in front of this person who have a height greater than or equal to h. Write an algorithm to reconstruct the queue.Note:The number of people is less than 1,100.ExampleInput:[[7,0], [4,4], [7,1], [5,0], [6,1], [5,2]]Output:[[5,0], [7,0], [5,2], [6,1], [4,4], [7,1]]"""class Solution:    def reconstructQueue(self, people):        """        :type people: List[List[int]]        :rtype: List[List[int]]        """        res=[]        hList=sorted(list(set([i[0] for i in people])))[::-1]        for k in hList:            kList=sorted([i for i in people if i[0]==k])            for i in kList:                res.insert(i[1],i)        return res
