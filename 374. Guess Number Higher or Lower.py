"""We are playing the Guess Game. The game is as follows:I pick a number from 1 to n. You have to guess which number I picked.Every time you guess wrong, I'll tell you whether the number is higher or lower.You call a pre-defined API guess(int num) which returns 3 possible results (-1, 1, or 0):-1 : My number is lower 1 : My number is higher 0 : Congrats! You got it!Example:n = 10, I pick 6.Return 6."""# The guess API is already defined for you.# @param num, your guess# @return -1 if my number is lower, 1 if my number is higher, otherwise return 0# def guess(num):class Solution(object):    def guessNumber(self, n):        """        :type n: int        :rtype: int        """        ans=n//2        l=1        h=n        print(ans)        while(guess(ans)!=0):            if guess(ans)==1:                l=ans+1            else:                h=ans-1            ans=(l+h)//2            print(ans)        return ans
